Hello,

I hope you are well!

So sorry it has taken me so long to write. It's been pretty much non-stop here, we arrrived early April and I started my job late April. There was lots to learn in the new role (still is), it is quite a different community centre to SPLC. We are funded by both the state and local government which is great, but it means there's a lot of reporting to do to keep up the funding. We also serve a wide range of demographics, from providing courses for retirees (that part is much like SPLC) to food for the homeless and volunteering/socialising opportunities for the disabled.
