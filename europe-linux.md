# The End of Windows 10, Proliferation of Web Apps and Rise of the Europen Ameriskeptics: An Opportunity for an Aternative Operating System

Some intro paragraph. Before we examine the reasons behind the shift, let's look at the the dominant alternative: Linux-based operating systems.
## The Alternative: Linux-Based Operating Systems
As it is currently not a consumer desktop operating system, you won't find a Linux-powered computer when you walk into JB Hifi or Officeworks. However, the open-source Linux powers 70% of the world's 7 billion smartphones (Android is a Linux-based operating system) and most of the world's supercomputers. It also powers the worldwide web, with 96% of webservers running on Linux. And all this started from a personal programming project of one Linus Torvalds in 1991.

While Linux keeps the digital world ticking in the background, it's presence on consumer and office desktop computers has been scant, due to the decades of dominance from Microsoft's Windows and Apple's MacOS. But things could be changing, at least in the European public service, where people are starting to ask why significant public funds are being spent on a US IT company, when a free open-source alternative exists. 

## The Perfect Storm
### End of Windows 10
The current version of Windows is Windows 11, however there as of June, half the windows computers in the world are still running Windows 10. It is getting financially unviable for Microsoft to continue to support both Windows 10 and Windows 11, so in October 2025, Windows 10 will be rendered obsolete, and so will computers that are not able to upgrade to Windows 11 (which is all computers built before 2017). It is estimated that this will lead to a large scale ewaste event, with ... computers being discarded. As Linux can chug along on the oldest of computers (here's a video of a 2007 Fujitsu playing Apple TV in the browser), there are initiatives to promote moving to Linux, to reduce the effects of this coming ewaste tsunami, the most notable being the global initiative endof10.org

### Proliferation of Web Apps
More than ever, apps run in browsers. Do we need Windows? Do we need an operationg system? Can't we just have a computer that runs a browser and nothing else?

### Rise of the Ameriskeptics
From a political perspective, Europe has become skeptical of US foreign policy, and this has spilled over to the IT sector. All of Europe runs on Microsoft Windows, a US-based operating system, and now they are starting to ask why.

## France

## Germany

## China

## North Korea

## Australia?
Back home in Australia, looking at the seeds of Microsoft Windows dissent around the world, could Linux gain a beachhead? There have been no initiatives at the moment from any Australian government department. However there is a possibility that Linux could gain a foothold in the digital inclusion space.

## Digital Inclusivity
While Australia has been relatively progressive in advocating for inclusivity for examlple in the indigineous and LGBTQ+ spaces, this is not generally the case when it comes to digital inclusivity. While NGO initiatives exist that provide low cost or free computers (Microsoft Windows of course) to the financially disadvantaged, government bodies will still email you a .doc or .docx Microsoft Word file. It is taken for granted that 'anyone with a computer' should be able to open it. However it mostly cannot be opened by anyone who hasn't paid Microsoft the annual $150+ Office 365 subscription. A more inclusive policy would have been to email documents as a PDF (originally developed by Adobe, PDF has been an open format since 2008, so is supported by all operating systems). If we focused on enacting such digitally inclusive procedures, this would benefit those who choose not to subscribe to Office 365. But not only that, this would remove a significant barrier to the use of Microsoft-free computers.

In Australia we are still way behind the eight ball compared to the Europeans when it comes to weaning ourselves off Microsoft. However, with small initiatives such as sending out PDF instead of .docx, you and I can start progressing twoards a small change from a grassroots level. A next-level initiative would be to try out a Linux desktop, and for the digitally adventurous: to ultimately remove your dependence on Microsoft. From a one-person initiative, this could move to small businesses or small community organisations and so on.
